## Containers

This project has you setting up several containers with a service in each one that come together to serve a Wordpress website.

The three containers that are setup are:

-   Nginx: Uses it's [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) capability to execute and request from the Wordpress container the pages it will later respond with to the client. It's the only container that has external ports.

-   Wordpress: Using PHP-FPM and wordpress is used to deliver the content to the client.

-   MariaDB: A MariaDB database is used to store the data generated by Wordpress

A common network is created for the three containers to communicate with each other.

And two volumes are created, one for the Wordpress container to store the data and another for the MariaDB container to store the database.
